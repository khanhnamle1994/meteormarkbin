This is the tutorial you've been looking for to master building dynamic web apps with Meteor JS, with all the most important topics covered in great depth!

Authentication?  Covered.  Routing?  Of course!  Security? We got it.

Meteor JS can get you a position in web development or help you build that personal project you've been dreaming of.  Meteor is the ultimate framework for developer productivity; it is bar-none the fastest technology you can use to make fast and interactive web apps in just a few hours.

This course will get you up and running quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build interesting apps with Meteor and React.

We'll start by mastering the fundamentals of React, including JSX, “props", “state", and eventing. Source code is provided for each lecture, so you will always stay up-to-date with the course pacing.
